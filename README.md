I am currently a full time student attending ASU for a bachelors in Graphic Information Technology. My goal after college is to travel and find opportunities to collaborate on projects all over the world.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Travel%20and%20places/Flying%20Saucer.png" alt="Flying Saucer" width="25" height="25" />

I am a novice coder and have also been learning to use Adobe Creative Cloud. I am a fast learner and always eager to be on the quest for new knowledge.

This is a short and messy comic I illustrated recently about a toad experiencing road rage (or as I like to call it, Toad Rage <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Animals/Worm.png" alt="Worm" width="25" height="25" /> !)  I love to create art in my free time in addition to creating commissioned work :-)
